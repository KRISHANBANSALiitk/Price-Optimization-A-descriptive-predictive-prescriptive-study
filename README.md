# Price-Optimization-A-descriptive-predictive-prescriptive-study
Develop a data science pipeline for pricing and distribution of avocados to maximize revenue.

This notebook walks through a decision-making pipeline that culminates in a mathematical optimization model. There are three stages:

First, understand the dataset and infer the relationships between categories such as the sales, price, region, and seasonal trends.
Second, build a prediction model that predicts the demand for avocados as a function of price, region, year and the seasonality.
Third, design an optimization problem that sets the optimal price and supply quantity to maximize the net revenue while incorporating costs for wastage and transportation.
